// ROCr allows users to filter and reorder various Gpu devices that are
// present on ROCm system. This ability is made available via environment
// variable ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES (RVD). Users are allowed to specify a list
// of Gpu Identifiers separated by comma delimiter as the value of this env
// variable.
//
// On a ROCm platform instance, a Gpu device could be identified by its:
//
//    Index - Position at which ROCr reports it upon device enumeration
//    UUID  - A string that is unique and is immutable i.e. tags Gpu
//            instance across systems and power cycles. UUID values
//            are defined to begin with "GPU-" prefix
//
//    @note: Not all Gpu devices will report valid UUID's. For example,
//    Only devices from Gfx9 and later will encode valid UUID's. To account
//    for this and other reasons, the UUID string "GPU-XX" is defined as
//    indicating those devices. Users can still select those Gpu devices
//    by using their enumeration index
//
//  Users are allowed to select a device by specifying its UUID string in
//  full or part. A UUID string that does not uniquely match an agent's
//  valid UUID prefix is interpreted as terminating. The UUID string
//  "GPU-XX" will not match and therefore will terminate
//
//  RVD interpreter treats an empty token list as filtering all devices.
//    Users can use this mode to report ZERO Gpu devices
//
//  RVD interpreter treats a token as Illegal if can't be evaluated into an
//    instance of Device UUID or Enumeration Index
//
//  RVD interpreter treats a Legal instance of Enumeration Index as Terminating
//    if any ONE of the following conditions apply:
//      Value of index lies outside the interval [0 - (numGpuDevices - 1)]
//      Value of index maps to a device that has been previously selected
//
//  RVD interpreter treats a Legal instance of Device UUID as Terminating
//    if any ONE of the following conditions apply:
//      Value of UUID is the literal "GPU-XX"
//      Value of UUID matches ZERO devices on system
//      Value of UUID matches TWO or more devices on system
//      Value of UUID maps to a device that has been previously selected
//
//  RVD interpreter builds the list of Gpu devices to surface using tokens
//    that are Legal and NOT Terminating
//
//  Following are some examples of RVD value strings and their intepretation
//  on a ROCm system with four Gpu devices. Assume for now the UUID's of the
//  four Gpu devices are:
//    Gpu-0: "GPU-BABABABABABABABA"
//    Gpu-1: "GPU-ABBAABBAABBAABBA"
//    Gpu-2: "GPU-BABAABBAABBABABA"
//    Gpu-3: "GPU-ABBABABABABAABBA"
//
//    Surface ZERO devices
//    A1) ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES=""
//    A2) ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES="-1"
//    A3) ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES="GPU-XX"
//
//    Surface Gpu-3 and Gpu-0 devices in that order
//    B) ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES="3,GPU-BABABABABABABABA,4"
//
//    Surface Gpu-1 and Gpu-2 devices in that order
//    C) ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES="1,GPU-ABBAABBAABBAABBA,GPU-XX"
//
//    Surface Gpu-3 and Gpu-2 devices in that order
//    D) ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES="3,GPU-BABAABBA,GPU-XX"
