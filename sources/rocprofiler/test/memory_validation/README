Memory Validation Tests

The tests here are used to validate TCP and TCC.  The validation focuses on the
commonly used stats like cache hit/miss, and memory traffic. The kernels used
for testing are dedicated ones, e.g., pointer chase,showing regular parrterns,
and thus providing expected stats.

The testing workflow is that:
1) dedicated kernels will be executed and profiled using the specified
counters/events in rocprofiler;
2) profiling results will be parsed using the provided scripts, and compared
against expected values (self-checking);
3) the comparion results are printed onto screen to show the test is a pass or
fail.

#### How to run ####
1) step into the test folder
 $cd test/memory_validation/

2) run tests
 to start all tests
 $run.sh
 or, to separtely run each
 $run_scripts/test_cache_miss.sh [TCP/TCC/TCP TCC]
 $run_scripts/test_fetchwrite_size.sh

#### Known issues ####
while all tests have be thoroughly tests on Vega 10 and all show [PASS],
occasionally some tests show [FAIL]. Possbile reasons is interference onto test
benchmarks from runtime processes. You just need to run the tests again.
