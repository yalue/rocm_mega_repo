Note: This folder is primarily intended for AMD internal developers.

The folder lib_helper contains the script to generate SP3 library libamdsp3.a
and the associated header files in the current folder for kfdtest to use. 
cmake is required for the script to run. Just run ./build_sp3.sh after setting
up the environment variables (source build/envsetup.sh).
