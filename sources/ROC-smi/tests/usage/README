The usage tests here are designed to test the SMI's detection of
functionality that is dependent on other things running, like
process creation, VRAM usage, etc.

To build a test, simply compile the test using gcc, then run the test
Run the test with -h/--help to find out the parameters for each test.

Specific test notes and instructions follow below:

======= testPids ==================
Requires: Thunk (HSAKMT/ROCT) headers and lib
Using default thunk installation location, create the test binary with:
C_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/rocm/include gcc ./testPids.c -L/opt/rocm/lib -lhsakmt -o testPids
If thunk is not installed, point the C_INCLUDE_PATH and -L path accordingly
